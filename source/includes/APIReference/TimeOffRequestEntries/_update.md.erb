### HTTP Request

<img src="images/put.png" alt="put"/><api>https://rest.tsheets.com/api/v1/time_off_request_entries</api>

### Properties
_Pass an array of [Time Off Request Entry](#the-time-off-request-entry-object) objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

When editing a time off request entry you must uniquely identify it by passing in its id. All other properties defined on a [Time Off Request Entry](#the-time-off-request-entry-object) object may be passed in to the request with a new value in order to change it. If the value passed in is the same as it was previously, or if a particular property is not passed in at all, it will be ignored.

### Status Codes

Each time off request entry that is edited will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the time off request entry was edited successfully. If there was a problem editing the time off request entry, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.
