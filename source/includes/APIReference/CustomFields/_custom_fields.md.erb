# Custom Fields

Custom Fields (aka "Advanced Tracking") provide a means to extend the data that is tracked on employee time cards to capture custom activities beyond time tracking, e.g. mileage, equipment, expenses, etc.  A maximum of 6 Custom Fields can be 'active' on an account at any given time.
