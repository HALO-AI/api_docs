### HTTP Request

<img src="images/put.png" alt="put"/><api>https://rest.tsheets.com/api/v1/customfielditem_filters</api>

### Properties
_Pass an array of customfielditemfilter objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **id**<br/>required | _Int_ | Id of the customfielditemfilter. |

All other `read-write` properties defined on an [Item Filter](#the-item-filter-object) object may be 
passed in to the request with a new value in order to change it. If the value passed in is the same 
as it was previously, or if a particular property is not passed in at all, it will be ignored.

### Status Codes
Each customfielditemfilter that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the customfielditemfilter was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a customfielditemfilter, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.
