| **user_id**<br/>optional | _Int_ | Defaults to the requesting user (based on the Access Token). Only administrators or group managers may add time off requests for users other than themselves.

### Status Codes

Each time off request that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the time off request was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a time off request, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Time off request was created successfully. |
| <code class="level400">403</code> | Permission Denied. The requesting user does not have permission to create the time off request for this user. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this time off request. See the `_status_extra value` for more detail. |
