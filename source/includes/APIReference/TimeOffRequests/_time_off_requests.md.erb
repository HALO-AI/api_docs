# Time Off Requests

Time Off Requests are used to track paid or unpaid time off in TSheets.  Requests are submitted by team members or by admins/managers on their behalf.  Once they are approved, a timesheet is generated for each request entry.  Then the time off timesheets can be exported or summarized in reports as usual.
